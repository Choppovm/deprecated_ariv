# [DEPRECATED] ARIV Utilities Website
In-game activity logging site for ARI-V staff. 

## Deprecated as of 06.09.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY).
ARIV has been deleted by hammers. This website is no longer being hosted.

If anybody wishes to reuse the code from this website, view the repository from a previous time. No, I won't be helping you set it up, I have other things I'm doing.

## 12.09.2025 Update (DD.MM.YYYY)
Readded the old files; no more do you have to go looking through the commits history.

Felt a bit stupid naming the repository "deprecated", then just deleting all the files and making it a hassle for users to go and find them all (also it adds back profile stats). 

For those who were trying to use this and had to go through the history to manually copy it all over, sorry about that, hope it's easier now.

For the others asking what I used to host the site: Netlify. GitHub didn't let me make secrets/environmental variables/whatever they're called for some reason, and I couldn't be asked to try and get it to work, so I swapped over to netlify.

My netlify account is deleted, and this website is no longer being hosted as a result of it. Don't try following any links/URLs, they will not work. 

(and no, this isn't going to be turned into a github pages site. i don't have time for that.)
